This topic discusses the basics of using Varnish as a web caching accelerator for Magento.

<h2 id="use-varnish-magento-purge">Varnish purging</h2>
According to <a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/trunk/users-guide/purging.html" target="_blank">Varnish documentation</a>, "A *purge* is what happens when you pick out an object from the cache and discard it along with its variants." A Varnish purge is very similar to a Magento cache clean command (or clicking **Flush Magento Cache** in the Magento Admin).

In fact, as discussed in this section, when you manually refresh the Magento cache, Varnish purges as well.

After you've installed and configured Varnish to work with Magento, the following actions can result in a Varnish purge:

*	Maintaining a website

	For example, anything you do in the Admin in:

	*	**STORES** > **Configuration** > GENERAL > **General**
	*	**STORES** > **Configuration** > GENERAL > **Currency Setup**
	*	**STORES** > **Configuration** > GENERAL > **Store Email Addresses**

	When Magento detects such a change, a message displays informing you to refresh the cache. To do this, see <a href="#use-varnish-cache">Refresh the Magento cache</a>.

*	Maintaining a store (for example, adding or editing categories, prices, products, and promotional pricing rules)

	Varnish is purged automatically when you perform any of these tasks.

*	Maintaining source code. 

	You should refresh the cache and periodically delete everything in the `var/generation` and `var/di` directories. For information on refreshing the cache, see <a href="#use-varnish-cache">Refresh the Magento cache</a>.

<h2 id="use-varnish-cache">Refresh the Magento cache</h2>
You can refresh the Magento cache (also referred to as *cleaning* the cache) in the Magento Admin or using the command line.

To refresh the cache using the Admin, click **SYSTEM** > Tools > **Cache Management**, then click **Flush Magento Cache** at the top of the page. (You can also refresh individual cache types.)

To refresh the cache using the command line, you typically use the <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-cache.html#config-cli-subcommands-cache-clean">`magento cache:clean [type]`</a> command as the Magento file system owner.

<h2 id="use-varnish-magento-purge">Purge multiple Varnish hosts</h2>
*Coming soon*. You'll be able to configure Magento to purge multiple Varnish hosts in the same request. Watch this space.
