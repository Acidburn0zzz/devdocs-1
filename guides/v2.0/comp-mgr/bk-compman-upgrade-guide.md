<h2>Getting started with the Component Manager and System Upgrade</h2>   
Magento provides two applications you can use after installing the Magento application to keep it and any installed components up-to-date:

*	<a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}comp-mgr/compman-start.html">Component Manager</a>

	Updates *components*, which can be any of the following:

	*	Modules (extend Magento capabilities)
	*	Themes (change the look and feel of your storefront and Admin)
	*	Language packages (localize the storefront and Admin)

	*Update* means updating the component version, uninstalling it, enabling it, or disabling it.

*	<a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}comp-mgr/upgrader/upgrade-start.html">System Upgrade</a>

	Upgrade the Magento core modules as well as components.
