After you pass all readiness checks, you can back up:

*	The Magento 2 file system (excluding `var` and `pub/static` directories)
*	The `pub/media` directory
*	The Magento 2 database

Backups are stored in the `var/backups` directory and can be restored at any time using the <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}install-gde/install/cli/install-cli-uninstall-mods.html#instgde-cli-uninst-mod-roll">magento setup:rollback</a> command.

The following figure shows an example of backing up everything.

To back up:

1.	Select the check box of each item to back up and click **Create Backup**.

	(If you choose not to back up, clear all check boxes and click **Next**).

	<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info">
      <p>We strongly recommend you <em>do</em> back up in the event of issues.</p>
    </div>

2. 	Wait while backups are created.

The following page displays to confirm a successful backup. If errors display, see <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}comp-mgr/trouble/cman/tshoot_backup.html">Troubleshoot backups</a>.
