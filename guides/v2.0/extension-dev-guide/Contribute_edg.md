We encourage our community members to add content; either by writing a full topic, adding new sections to existing topic, or even just adding a few sentences about something you know on an existing topic. Don't worry about perfect grammar or form; just get your brilliance down!!

The files are mostly written in the markdown language (and HTML where needed). 

To get started, review the <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}contributor-guide/contributing.html">Contributor Guide</a> to learn about the process for code and doc contributions, including how to fork the repository and do a Pull Request to have your work submitted and reviewed.

Then, review the Table of Contents in the left pane of the Guide, and determine which topic areas you can contribute to, or any that might be missing.

To add your knowledge to our Docs, you can:

* edit your local version of an existing file
* use the <a href="{{ site.githuburl }}template.md">generic template</a> and write a brand new topic, we will find the right home for it in the appropriate Guide.
* use an existing, empty template to write about a topic that we know we need, but haven't yet gotten around to writing


Create a Pull Request to have your contribution reviewed by the DevDocs team. 

Your contributions to our Docs and your experience with using Magento are very valued and appreciated. Let us know if you have any questions!
