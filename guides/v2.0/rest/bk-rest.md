The REST API documentation provided on [devdocs.magento.com](http://devdocs.magento.com) describes the APIs that are provided in standard, out-of-the-box Magento installations. 

Additionally, because an installation may contain third-party modules and extension attributes, Magento provides the mechanism to view REST API documentation that is generated on the fly.

Use the following link to view the dynamically-generated REST documentation:

`http://<magento_host>/rest/default/schema`

See <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}/rest/rest_endpoints.html">REST schema endpoints</a> for a list of available services.
