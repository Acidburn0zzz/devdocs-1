<h2 id="mtf_block_overview">Block overview</h2>
Block is the area of user interface aimed to perform concrete functionality, for example, Search Box, Header, Footer.

The block object pattern is used in the MTF to avoid unnecessary duplication of code and makes tests easier to support.

A block can have the following features:

- Block can contain other blocks.
- Block can be used in several pages and blocks.

In this topic we will create new block and explore its structure. You will learn about renders, form mapping, and merging pages.
